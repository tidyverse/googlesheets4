```{r setup, include = FALSE}
can_decrypt <- gargle:::secret_can_decrypt("googlesheets4")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",
  error = TRUE,
  purl = can_decrypt,
  eval = can_decrypt
)
```

```{r eval = !can_decrypt, echo = FALSE, comment = NA}

```

```{r}
library(googlesheets4)
```

Basic Sheet reading is shown in the [Get started](https://googlesheets4.tidyverse.org/articles/googlesheets4.html) article. Here we show how to target a specific (work)sheet or cell range, how to deal with column types, and how to get detailed cell data.

## Auth

As a regular, interactive user, you can just let googlesheets4 prompt you for anything it needs re: auth.

Since this article is compiled noninteractively on a server, we have arranged for googlesheets4 to use a service account token (not shown).

```{r include = FALSE}
# happens in .onLoad() when IN_PKGDOWN, but need this for local dev/preview
googlesheets4:::gs4_auth_docs(drive = TRUE) 

# attempt to reduce quota exhaustion problems
if (identical(Sys.getenv("IN_PKGDOWN"), "true")) Sys.sleep(30)
```

## `read_sheet()` and `range_read()` are synonyms

The main "read" function of the googlesheets4 package goes by two names, because we want it to make sense in two contexts:

* `read_sheet()` evokes other table-reading functions, like
 `readr::read_csv()` and `readxl::read_excel()`. The `sheet` in this case
  refers to a Google (spread)Sheet.
  
* `range_read()` is technically the right name according to the naming
  convention used throughout the googlesheets4 package, because we can read from
  an arbitrary cell range.
  
`read_sheet()` and `range_read()` are synonyms and you can use either one. Throughout this article, we're going to use `range_read()`.

Note: The first release of googlesheets used a `sheets_` prefix everywhere, so we had `sheets_read()`. It still works, but it's deprecated and will go away
rather swiftly.

## Specify the range and column types

Here we read from the "mini-gap" and "deaths" example Sheets to show some of the different ways to specify (work)sheet and cell ranges. 

```{r}
range_read(gs4_example("mini-gap"), sheet = 2)

range_read(gs4_example("mini-gap"), sheet = "Oceania", n_max = 3)

range_read(gs4_example("deaths"), skip = 4, n_max = 10)

```

The example below shows the use of `range` to specify both the (work)sheet and an A1-style cell range.

It also demonstrates how `col_types` gives control of column types, similar to how `col_types` works in readr and readxl. Note that currently there is only support for the "shortcode" style of column specification and we plan to align better with readr's capabilities in a future release.

* For the full list of column types and how to specify them, see the [Column specification](https://googlesheets4.tidyverse.org/reference/range_read.html#column-specification) section of the help for `range_read()`.

```{r}

range_read(
  gs4_example("deaths"), range = "other!A5:F15", col_types = "?ci??D"
)

```

If you looked at the "deaths" spreadsheet in the browser (it's [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tuYKzSbLukDLe5ymf_ZKdQA8SfOyeMM7rmf6D6NJpxg/edit#gid=1210215306)), you know that it has some of the typical features of real-world spreadsheets: the main data rectangle has prose intended for human consumption before and after it. That's why we have to specify the range when we read from it.

We've designated the data rectangles as [named ranges](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/63175?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en), which provides a very slick way to read them -- definitely less brittle and mysterious than approaches like `range = "other!A5:F15"` or `skip = 4, n_max = 10`. A named range can be passed via the `range =` argument:

```{r}
gs4_example("deaths") %>% 
  range_read(range = "arts_data")
```

The named ranges, if any exist, are part of the information returned by `gs4_get()`.

## Detailed cell data

`range_read_cells()` returns a data frame with one row per cell and it gives access to raw cell data sent by the Sheets API.

```{r}
(df <- range_read_cells(gs4_example("deaths"), range = "E5:E7"))
df$cell[[3]]
```

Specify `cell_data = "full", discard_empty = FALSE` to get even more data if you, for example, need access to cell formulas or formatting.

`spread_sheet()` converts data in the "one row per cell" form into the data frame you get from `range_read()`, which involves reshaping and column typing.

```{r}
df %>% spread_sheet(col_types = "D")
## is same as ...
range_read(gs4_example("deaths"), range = "E5:E7", col_types ="D")
```

## When speed matters

If your Sheet is so large that the speed of `range_read()` is causing problems, consider `range_speedread()`. It uses a special URL that allows a Sheet to be read as comma-separated values (CSV). Access via this URL doesn't use the Sheets API (although `range_speedread()` still makes an API call to retrieve Sheet metadata). As an example, on a Sheet with around 57,000 rows and 25 columns (over 1.4 million cells), `range_speedread()` takes ~5 seconds, whereas `range_read()` takes closer to 3 minutes. Why wouldn't we always take the faster option?!? Because the speed difference is imperceptible for many Sheets and there are some downsides (described later).

`range_speedread()` has much the same interface as `range_read()`.

```{r}
gs4_example("gapminder") %>% 
  range_speedread(sheet = "Oceania", n_max = 3)
```

The output above reveals that, under the hood, `range_speedread()` calls an external function for CSV parsing (currently `readr::read_csv()`, but it is likely to switch to `vroom::vroom()`). An important consequence is that all arguments around column type specification are passed along to the CSV-parsing function. Here is a demo using readr-style column specification:

```{r}
gs4_example("deaths") %>% 
  range_speedread(
    range = "other!A5:F15",
    col_types = readr::cols(
      Age = readr::col_integer(),
      `Date of birth` = readr::col_date("%m/%d/%Y"),
      `Date of death` = readr::col_date("%m/%d/%Y")
    )
  )
```

Compare that to how we would read the same data with `range_read()`:

```{r}
gs4_example("deaths") %>% 
  range_read(range = "other_data", col_types = "??i?DD")
```

This example highlights two important differences:

  * `range = "other!A5:F15"` versus `range = "other_data"`: `range_speedread()`
    can't access a named range, whereas `range_read()` can.
  * `readr::col_date("%m/%d/%Y")` vs `D`: `range_speedread()` must parse a
    character representation of all cell data, including datetimes, whereas 
    `range_read()` has access to the actual cell data and its type.

What's the speed difference for something like the Africa sheet in the
"gapminder" example Sheet? (around 625 rows x 6 columns, or 3700 cells)

```{r}
system.time(
  gs4_example("gapminder") %>% range_speedread(sheet = "Africa")
)
system.time(
  gs4_example("gapminder") %>% range_read(sheet = "Africa")
)
```

The modest difference above shows that the speed difference is unlikely to be a gamechanger in many settings.

Summary of how to think about `range_speedread()` vs `range_read()`:

  * Both use auth (literally, send a token), unless there was a prior call to
    `gs4_deauth()`.
  * `range_speedread()` is faster, but it's not noticeable for typical Sheets.
  * `range_speedread()` uses readr-style column type specification, which is
    actually more flexible than what `range_read()` currently does. In future
    googlesheets4 releases, we will adopt readr-style column type specification.
  * `range_speedread()` requires more detailed column type specification,
    because it cannot access unformatted cell data and the actual cell type, as
    `range_read()` can.
  * `range_speedread()` can't access full cell data, e.g., formatting.
  * `range_speedread()` can't work with named ranges.
